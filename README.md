# wordsyoumet

*Words You Met* is a web service that enables you to share languages you have met, heard or you have been inspired, encouraged or even hurt.

This product is designed for running on Google App Engine platform, using Slim3 framework, and with a bit old version.

The service was also introduced at a hackathon event, Challengers 2012 Spring, presented by NTT Resonant, Inc.

## NOTICE

Since this product is *just a prototype*, users may probably encounter issues or bugs. :-)
